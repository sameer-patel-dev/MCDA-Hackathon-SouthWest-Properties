I’m maintaining therapy and cannot see finances stopping anytime soon. I also receive a rent subcity which generates based on the amount of rent per month. Right now, I receive an extra $450 towards my rent.\nI’m very clean and prior to returning to school I owned a cleaning company which I operated for 3+ years with over 40 clients (can show reviews of services). I’m quiet as I do have a baby but we love music and Ms. Rachel.\nThe place we currently live in is a 2 bedroom - 600sqft mini home. This is very small for us. We made it work the best way we could but it’s definitely time to find something larger.\nI am open to move in date as my landlord is very sentimental towards this situation.\nThanks so very much.\nLook forward to hearing if anything may be available.\nSincerely,\nKelsey']}
