Two bedrooms (one bedroom is slightly smaller than the other), one bathroom (bathtub), with a large living area, a small kitchen, balcony, and lots of closets for storage (5). The place has lots of natural light and windows. The place is very close to the grocery stores/quinpool area, and it's about a 15 minute walk to Dalhousie. The #7 bus also goes by our place via Robie (100 meter walk) so if you want to bus to school it's very easy.", "Cat friendly (with written permission from the landlord) and non-smoking.

Tenants insurance required (ours is 30$/month). There is no access to laundry in the building, however directly across the street is a laundromat (15 meters door to door). We are offering a reduced rate because we've been here for a while at $1850.00 each per month for May-August. However, if you’re interested in remaining in the apartment building in the fall as well (starting Sept 1st), you would be subject to a new year-long fixed lease with the landlord (A&T Properties) and a separate application. Our landlord is very business, but very respectful and quick to fix issues, and very open to anyone who wants to sign on in the fall after showcasing their good fit for the building. With respect to 2024/25 leases, the 2024/25 lease prices have not yet been finalized. However, two bedroom apartments leased in 2023/24 to ‘new' tenants were leased between $2195 - 2395/month with water, HW and heat.", 'If you are interested in purchasing any furniture as well, we are moving and not keeping anything so there are furnishings available for an additional price.', "If you're interested please send me an email and I will send you the application form and set up a showing."]}
