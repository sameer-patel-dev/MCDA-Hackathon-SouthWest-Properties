# Housing_WebScraping

The property management and apartment rental industry in Halifax lacks a comprehensive and centralized platform for accessing and analyzing up-to-date market rental rates (rent and parking). There is a notable absence of a system that efficiently scrapes or mines the web for rental market data and organizes it into a meaningful dashboard model for the management and leasing team. A tool that could assist the organization in making informed decisions on current competitive rental rates and setting future rates and increases.
