We are looking for a new roommate for our apartment, our roommate is leaving and we need a new person to take over the room. Ideally we are looking for a longterm roommate to rent, but we are open to short term.
Aside from our roommate, I live here with my fiancé, I'm a cisgender gay man, he is a transgender bisexual man. We are both 24.
Internet: $30
Power Bill: Varies, every second month
Rent: $702
Everything else is included for bills except laundry machine fees, which are located on a different floor of our building.
The new roommate will need to supply their own bedroom furniture as our current roommate is taking his when he leaves. Rest of the apt is furnished.
We have two cats, named Chester and Delilah, but no additional pets are allowed.
We like to smoke weed, but don't use nicotine or cigarettes, dont really drink, and usually just chill at home. We sometimes smoke weed in our bedroom when it's cold or very windy out, but we seal the room and cover the smell so it doesn't get to the rest of the apt.
Parking is extra.",44.65514,-63.58403,2024-04-12
