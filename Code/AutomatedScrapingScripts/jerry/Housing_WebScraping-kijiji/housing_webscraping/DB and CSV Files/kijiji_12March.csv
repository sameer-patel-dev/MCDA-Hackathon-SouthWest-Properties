Our goal is to acquire or build 1,000 units by 2030, transitioning units from the private sector to the community or non-profit sector and building in partnership to create a stock of perpetually affordable housing.,We’ll implement our “mixed income” model at all our buildings, ensuring they are more affordable to working households and people on fixed incomes. The combination of rent levels in each building helps keep the building financially sustainable and allows a range of households to afford to live in a neighbourhood. That can help keep a community diverse and vibrant. We’ll also work to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings to help control costs and achieve environmental goals.,We currently have 1 Bachelor unit and 2 one-bedroom units available in Halifax. These units have been renovated with modern appliances, updated bathrooms and kitchens, new flooring and painting throughout. Eligible tenants must have a household income of between $30,000 and $75,000 per year and must show proof of employment, identification and insurance coverage. Monthly rent for one bedroom units are starting at $1,350 per month, Monthly rent for a 2 bedroom unit is $1,695. Heat and hot water included in the monthly rent.

Single Parent Looking for Safe Haven,1500,"NS-102, Halifax, NS, B3G 1R3",2024-02-21T15:35:41.000Z,20 days ago,Apartment,2,1,,Not Included,1,1 Year,Limited,800,No,,No,,No,,Owner,,"Hello there,
I’m currently looking for a bigger place for my daughter and I. She’s currently 9 months old and an amazing baby. I’m currently on Workers Compensation due to a workplace event, which left scars. I’m maintaining therapy and cannot see finances stopping anytime soon. I also receive a rent subcity which generates based on the amount of rent per month. Right now, I receive an extra $450 towards my rent.
I’m very clean and prior to returning to school I owned a cleaning company which I operated for 3+ years with over 40 clients (can show reviews of services). I’m quiet as I do have a baby but we love music and Ms. Rachel.
The place we currently live in is a 2 bedroom - 600sqft mini home. This is very small for us. We made it work the best way we could but it’s definitely time to find something larger.
I am open to move in date as my landlord is very sentimental towards this situation.
Thanks so very much.
Look forward to hearing if anything may be available.
Sincerely,
Kelsey",44.60273,-63.45299
