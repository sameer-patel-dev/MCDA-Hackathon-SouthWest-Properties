I’m currently looking for a bigger place for my daughter and I. She’s currently 9 months old and an amazing baby. I’m currently on Workers Compensation due to a workplace event, which left scars. I’m maintaining therapy and cannot see finances stopping anytime soon. I also receive a rent subcity which generates based on the amount of rent per month. Right now, I receive an extra $450 towards my rent.
I’m very clean and prior to returning to school I owned a cleaning company which I operated for 3+ years with over 40 clients (can show reviews of services). I’m quiet as I do have a baby but we love music and Ms. Rachel.
The place we currently live in is a 2 bedroom - 600sqft mini home. This is very small for us. We made it work the best way we could but it’s definitely time to find something larger.
I am open to move in date as my landlord is very sentimental towards this situation.
Thanks so very much.
Look forward to hearing if anything may be available.
Sincerely,
Kelsey",44.60273,-63.45299,2024-03-19
