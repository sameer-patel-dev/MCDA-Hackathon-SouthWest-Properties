I have 3 kids so ideally the place would have 2-3 bedrooms. I’m ok with either. I make about $2200 from my job, and then $2800 from benefits. (Child tax and assistance) so $5000 a month. So I get more than enough to cover rent. Please let me know if you have anything or know somewhere I can go. I have applied for rental assistance as well to help me cover the costs. I have 1 car, I don’t need a space street parking is fine. I don’t have any pets, and don’t need it to be furnished I can bring my own things. I am on the waiting list for housing but they informed me that the waiting list is currently 3 years long for the immediate housing. 5 years on the regular list.\nI appreciate all assistance.

Right now, I receive an extra $450 towards my rent.\nI’m very clean and prior to returning to school I owned a cleaning company which I operated for 3+ years with over 40 clients (can show reviews of services). I’m quiet as I do have a baby but we love music and Ms. Rachel.\nThe place we currently live in is a 2 bedroom - 600sqft mini home. This is very small for us. We made it work the best way we could but it’s definitely time to find something larger.\nI am open to move in date as my landlord is very sentimental towards this situation.\nThanks so very much.\nLook forward to hearing if anything may be available.\nSincerely,\nKelsey']}
